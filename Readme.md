# Set Cover Problem Solver

This Python program solves the Set Cover Problem using various algorithms: Branch and Bound (BnB), Approximation (Approx), Local Search 1 (LS1), and Local Search 2 (LS2).

## Usage
Run the program from the command line with the following arguments:

```bash
python main.py -inst <instance_file> -alg <algorithm> -time <cutoff_time> -seed <random_seed>

python generate_table.py

## Folder structure
1. All the algorithms script should be placed under `src`
2. Create 2 folders under `src`:
  1. The input data folder should be placed under `src/data`
  2. The output data folder should be placed under `src/output`
